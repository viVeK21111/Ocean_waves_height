-> detecting relation relation between categorical data and numeric data using boxplot or violinplot
-> removing outliers using boxplot and iqr method
-> corr between attrubutes using heatmap,searborn
-> using spearman correlation b/w the variables and target variable to check the relations between them
-> we can observe non-linear relations between them
-> using univariate selection to find the best attributes
